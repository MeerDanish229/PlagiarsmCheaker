# Plagiarism Detection Tool
This project is a simple plagiarism detection tool that leverages natural language processing libraries such as NLTK and spaCy to preprocess text documents and calculate similarity scores using TF-IDF vectors and cosine similarity. The tool features a GUI built with Tkinter, allowing users to load text files or input text directly, and compare the similarity between two texts to detect potential plagiarism.

# Features
Text Preprocessing: Tokenizes, lemmatizes, and removes stopwords from the input texts.
Similarity Detection: Uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to compute the similarity score between two texts.
User-Friendly Interface: A simple GUI that allows users to load text files or input text directly for comparison.
Natural Language Processing: Utilizes NLTK and spaCy for efficient text preprocessing.

## How it Works
Preprocess Text: Tokenizes and lemmatizes the input text, removing stopwords.
Vectorize Text: Converts the preprocessed text into TF-IDF vectors.
Calculate Similarity: Computes the cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors of the two input texts.
Display Result: Shows the similarity score in the GUI.
This tool provides a straightforward way to detect similarities between text documents, making it useful for educational and professional purposes.
